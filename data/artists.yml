    Slug: matt
    About:   Hey there, the name is Matt Maldonado and I have been in the art game since I could pick up a pencil. I am from the West Michigan area, Zeeland being where I came from. I am a tattoo artist who specializes in color or black and gray portraits/realism. Although that is my specialty my strengths also lie in color, pop-culture, Japanese and lettering. On top of tattooing I dabble in many other art forms such as graphic design, comic book illustration and digital or traditional illustration/painting. I’m super nerdy, super creative and hoping you choose me to make your next tattoo come to life! Stan Lee said it best...Excelsior!

-   Name: Britta
    FullName: Britta Lindemulder
    Slug: britta
    About:  My name is Britta Lindemulder and I’ve been tattooing in West Michigan since 2018. Ever since I can remember, I’ve always loved to draw. Many of my childhood friends still have doodles I made them. Growing up, my biggest influences were dinosaurs, sci-fi movies, video games and nature; which are still my interests today. I enjoy tattooing stylized illustrative linework, black and gray along with brightly colored pieces. My hair is also brightly colored, so you’ll never lose me in a crowd! I’m always learning and love to experiment with new art styles and subjects. I draw caricatures, illustrate and paint. My favorite thing about tattooing is collaborating with my clients to bring their ideas to life. I look forward to working with you and helping to make your tattoo dreams come true!
